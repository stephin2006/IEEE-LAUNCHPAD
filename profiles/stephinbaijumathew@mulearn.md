Kerala has a tech ecosystem that stands out as one of the most strategic, sustainable, and people-oriented in India. It emphasizes talent over trends. The state generates skilled professionals, and while many used to leave, an increasing number are now coming back or working remotely from Kerala, thanks to improved infrastructure and a better quality of life.
